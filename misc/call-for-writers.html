            Hello World,<br><br>
            I am looking for active and enthusiast people who are willing to write articles on Python Programming, Machine Learning and Big Data. I am not looking for experts, just basic knowledge would be more than enough to start with. I am currently an official <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/@dhrumilcse">contributing writer</a> at Towards Data Science. It is a well-known platform. You can dig on your own about TDS <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/">here</a> and also refer the <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/master-python-through-building-real-world-applications-part-1-b040b2b7faad">article</a> I wrote. I will be expecting a similar output from your side. Simple language, Easy to understand code and most importantly, well presented. <br><br>
            Of course, there are perks,<br>
            1— Learning, I believe, is the first and the most important perk one can expect. You will learn one tool/library per article. <br>
            2— I will mention your name and profile at the top of the article, which means you’ll gain attention from some important people from the Global Data Science Community. And trust me, it is a big deal.<br>
            3— Money indeed is important. You’ll receive pay (however; it won’t pay your bills) and that pay will be based upon your writing skills and how the article performs. If your only goal is money, this isn’t for you. <br><br>

            If you are interested, kindly share a link of your previous pieces of work. And if you don’t have any prior experience, prepare an article, draft it and send it to <a href="mailto:dhrumilcse14@gmail.com">my email</a>. You can choose your own way to send it, i.e. WordPress, Google Docs, PDF, Medium, Blogger (Google) or any other platform that you believe makes your article look good. However; <i>.doc</i> files will not be considered.<br>
            <hr>
            <p>
            P.S. In the email, you must mention <i>why</i> you want to do this <b>and</b> what it is that <i>inspires</i> you. And also, Subject line of the submission email should be 'Call for Writers' and nothing other than that. <br><br>

            P.P.S If you do not hear from me in 15 days, consider that, at moment, you are not eligible. But don't loose hope, work twice as hard because tenacity is the key.<br><br>

            Looking forward to seeing your great work,<br>
            Dhrumil <br><br>
