          <p>​The simple answer is yes, I need this. Need and not want, for my own peace of mind. <br></p>
          <p>​I am about to complete my Graduation, I do not have a girlfriend(and honestly I don't even need one), I lost my "best-friend" (alive, just not with me anymore) and neither I have a job nor an offer letter from the university I dreamt of going. So am I broke? No. I don't have everything I want but I have everything I need. I woke up with some aches and pain but I woke up. My life may not be perfect but I am blessed. I will work   towards my goal. Every. Single. Day.<br></p>

          <p>​However, whether I want it or not, ill-thoughs will hit me! Over thinking kills creativity and I won't let that happen to me. So, the first step I decided to take is to read often for new ideas and thoughts to flow in my mind and write more about things which brings me pure joy.​</p>
