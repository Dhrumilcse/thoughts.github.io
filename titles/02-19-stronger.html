              Right before entering into 2019, I felt a little bit of mental stress. I was done with both - my girlfriend and my girl(best)friend. Also, I am waiting for some results and I am at home for the past 7 months or so and I guess this might be a factor as well. However; anyone who knows me enough will say to you that I am the most stable guy you'll find. But even tho I felt that and I had to overcome it, no matter what. <br><br>
              I did. I avoided speaking until it is necessary to speak. Of course, I was working, exercising, reading and all but it was not enough. I started meditation and now I am back, stronger. I was able to get over it because I kinda grew up alone and I know how to handle it. If you are suffering from something similar, hit me up. I'll help you. I promise.
