            I am not a frequent traveller but taking a road trip with friends was long overdue. So we decided on one fine day and we left on the next without much planning. It was quite similar to what we saw in Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (except for money, of course!). <br>
            The rough idea was— 2 destinations, 3 days, 4 tires and 5 of us. <br>
            We decided to go to a place 185kms away from Mumbai (Lake side camping) and then Mumbai itself! We were travelling in April, In India that means temperature above 38°C throughout the day and around 30°C throughout the night. But, It rained for the duration. And by that I mean for the time we were on road, 30kms far from our destination. As soon as we reached our destination, in about half an hour, it stopped raining. If that ain't miracle, I don't know what is!

            </figure>

            <p align="justify">
            We left the place next day and we were about to reach Mumbai-Nashik highway, and out of no where one of us wanted to see the Vineyard and taste the wine. He googled the location of a nearby Vineyard (yes, Vineyard and not Wineyard), and fortunate enough it was only half an hour drive from there but on the opposite side of out next destination, Mumbai. We decided to go anyway. Sula Vineyards was the place. A must go for all, whether you are a wine lover or not. We saw how they make wine and taste 6 of them (don't get me wrong, it was the deal in package, two sip of each 6 different wine). The desert wine won my heart. If you ever decide to go there, 'Late Harvest Chenin Blanc' is a must try. About the package, it was INR375 for tour and tasting (INR125 for tour only) and age must be above 21.

            It was 10 pm (the same day) we came to Mumbai, as planned. And that day I realised that in true manners this city is always running! We were staying at the place of a very dear friend of mine(We were 5, I told him on the same day at 3:00pm and he still arranged everything. I am more than lucky to have him!) We stopped by his place, freshened up a little and with taking him along with us we left to experience the city at night. It was way more beautiful! It took us 3-4 hours! from Carter road to Sealink, from Shahrukh's to Salman's, fron Taj to Trident, from Marine to Terminal 2!
            We saw (not just saw, but experienced) everything that was possible during the night! And it was amazing!

            <p>We ended our short reoadtrip the next day with a pack full of memories. Not all, but short unplanned trips are the best ones. Don't you think so?</p>
