              It’s been a while since I wrote the last post about Karma and Happiness. I finished graduation and was planning for further education. I prepared for IELTS, which apparently most Indian students do when there is no other option, and scored a 7.0 within two months. I was not happy with the score at first but now I am okay with it. <br><br>

              The funny story? I thought my writing was good so I stopped writing these posts and focused on the other modules of the test. And guess what, I scored lowest on the writing module of all four. Hence, the gap you see down there in navigation from the July to September, that is my mistake. And my take? Never assume that you know everything. <br> <br>

              However; the score is good enough to get me into tier-1 University. There is nothing to regret about. But the thing about us, humans, is that this thing—knowing you could’ve done better but didn’t— haunts us. We can’t accept that fact. It makes us sad? Annoyed? Angry? I don’t know. But I do know that we want everyone else to know how hard we worked at it. How many sleepless nights we passed through to get this done. Right? Wrong. <br><br>

              In this meantime, I developed my love for reading as well, and I came across this beautiful line, which I believe is the answer why it is wrong. <br>

              <p>And on top of all, learn satisfaction. There will always be more and you don’t have to get it all. Don’t ruin the joy of achieving something by wishing you could’ve done better. </p><br>
