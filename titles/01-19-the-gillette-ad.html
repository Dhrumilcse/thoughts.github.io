            <p>Controversies take place every day. This time it's the new Gillette ad. Recently, they released an ad as a part of their new campaign &#34;The Best Men Can Be&#34;, the ad is lovely and conveys a positive message. Apparently, some men took it to their masculinity and that's the dumbest thing to derive from that ad. However; that's not my concern. <br><br>
            My problem is with the campaign design. As soon as I saw the ad, curious as always, I went to the campaign website because I wanted to know if I'm able to help in some way. But guess what, instead I found this long message they have written. In that they say, &#34;…Gillette is committing $1 million each year for 3 years…<i> in the United States </i> &#34; and blah blah, I haven't read after that. It pissed me off. Literally. <br><br>
            The only question I have is, why only the United States? I don't hold any grudges against the US just to be clear, but the kind of message you are conveying applies to rest of the world too. If you are stepping up, step up for all.
