					While my LinkedIn is full of certificate achievements, I am taking a break to discover what hobbies do I have, turns out a few. And it hit me.</br></br>

					Learning should never stop. But you should take a break once in a while and shift your focus to something you haven’t tried before, something you haven't done before but thought of doing it "some other time" not particularly something that makes you happy (everyone talks about doing things that makes you happy, duh) but something new that you think might make you happy. </br></br>

					Like painting </br>
					or fishing (boring but still) </br>
					or meditation (I tried mantra meditation and it brings peace) </br>
					or rank high in counter-strike (or any other games, chess perhaps) </br>
					or plant/grow something (Succulents are best-friends, as per my best-friend) </br>
					or learn calligraphy </br>
					or learn sign language (it is pretty easy) </br>
					or learn how to tie knots (for survival or for when you’re in the woods) </br>
					or create or find a new more soothing alarm tone </br>
					or try avocado </br>
					or go off the internet for 2-3 hours a day (like literally, no internet) </br>
					or organize your closet/desk </br>
					or watch space documentaries (UFOs are real, no kidding) </br>
					or above all, this is the right time to adopt dog(s) </br></br>

					The world has a lot to offer and we certainly haven’t tried the majority of it, how can you limit yourself to say that my hobby is to read a book? No, Karen, it’s not. You’re following others like baby ducks follow their mother. Or like the lambs. Do lambs follow? I don’t know, but you get my point, </br></br>

					Discover your thing. </br></br>
